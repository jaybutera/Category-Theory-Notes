(I chose python3)

1.
def id(x): return x

2.
def compose(a,b): return lambda x: a(b(x))

3.
// Return 16
compose(lambda x: x**2, id)(4)
compose(id, lambda x: x**2)(4)

Mapping the world-wide-web to a category requires more than just links as morphisms. If objects were pages and links
were the only morphisms, each page would need to link to itself (identity), and each page would need to link to all the pages
its linked pages linked to. That would be a lot of links. If we add another morphism as the ability to reach an object
from an object, we then have a category. Identity would be preserved because it is always possible to reach the page you
are currently on. Morphisms would preserve composition because (a~b ^ b~c -> a~c). That is, there is a way to reach
another object if there is a path to that object.

5.
Facebook is also not a category under the given mapping. In order to be a category, users would need to be friends with
themselves (identity) and friends with all their friends' friends (composition).

6.
A directed graph is a category when all nodes link to themselves (identity) and an edge from a to b with another edge
from b to c imples an edge from a to c exists (composition).
