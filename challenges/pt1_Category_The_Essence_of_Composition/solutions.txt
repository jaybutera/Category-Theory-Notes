(I chose python3)

1.
def id(x): return x

2.
def compose(a,b): return lambda x: a(b(x))

3.
// Return 16
compose(lambda x: x**2, id)(4)
compose(id, lambda x: x**2)(4)

4.
The world-wide-web is not a category since it does not necessarily guarentee identity and composition. In order for it
to be a category, each page would need to link to itself (identity), and each page would need to link to all the pages
its linked pages linked to. That would be a lot of links.

5.
Facebook is also not a category under the given mapping. In order to be a category, users would need to be friends with
themselves (identity) and friends with all their friends' friends (composition).

6.
A directed graph is a category when all nodes link to themselves (identity) and an edge from a to b with another edge
from b to c imples an edge from a to c exists (composition).
